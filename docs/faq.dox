- Why do I see "execvp: No such file or directory"?  
  The shell attempted to exec an external command that could not be resolved via PATH.

- How do I add a builtin?  
  Implement `int mycmd(int argc, char **argv)` and either add it to the core table or register it at runtime via `builtin_register`.

- How do I load a plugin?  
  Build a shared object that exposes `plugin_info_t *get_plugin_info(void)` and call `plugin_load("./myplugin.so")`.

- How do I suppress output in tests?  
  The test runner redirects stdout/stderr in setUp/tearDown. Use a similar pattern in your own tests to silence APIs while preserving Unity output.
